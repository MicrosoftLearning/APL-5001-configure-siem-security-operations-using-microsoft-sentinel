    title: 'Exercise 06: Perform Threat Hunting in Microsoft Sentinel'
    module: 'Guided Project - Create detections and perform investigations using Microsoft Sentinel'
---

## Exercise overview

Youâ€™re a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to detect and mitigate threats using Microsoft Sentinel. After connecting your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, you create custom analytics rules to help discover threats and anomalous behaviors in your environment.

Threat hunting queries enable and empower SOC analysts to proactively monitor and investigate potential attacks as they are developing or before they happen. Hunting within Microsoft Sentinel allows for queries that are similar to analytic rules be used to audit the environment for potentially malicious activities while allowing analysts to escalate results to incidents if needed. Sometimes, hunting threats may require data that goes beyond the retention of the analytics (hot) tier, this is where features like Search/Restore jobs can be used to ensure that the SOC has the data it needs.

## Exercise instructions

### Task 1: Create a hunting query

In this task, you will create a hunting query and bookmark a result.

1. Log in to WIN1 virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.  

1. In the Edge browser, navigate to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com>.

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Tenant Email** account provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Tenant Password** provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Sentinel*, then select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Select your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace.

1. Select **Logs**

1. Enter the following KQL Statement in the *New Query 1* space:

   >**Important:** Please paste any KQL queries first in Notepad and then copy from there to the *New Query 1* Log window to avoid any errors.

    ```KQL
    let lookback = 2d; 
    SecurityEvent 
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(lookback) 
    | where EventID == 4688 and Process =~ "powershell.exe"
    | extend PwshParam = trim(@"[^/\\]*powershell(.exe)+" , CommandLine) 
    | project TimeGenerated, Computer, SubjectUserName, PwshParam 
    | summarize min(TimeGenerated), count() by Computer, SubjectUserName, PwshParam 
    | order by count_ desc nulls last 
    ```
