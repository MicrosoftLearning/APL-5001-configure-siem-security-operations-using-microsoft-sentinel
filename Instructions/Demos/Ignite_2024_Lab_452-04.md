lab:
    title: 'Exercise 04: Create a Scheduled Query from a template'
    module: 'Guided Project - Create detections and perform investigations using Microsoft Sentinel'
---

## Exercise overview

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to detect and mitigate threats using Microsoft Sentinel. After connecting your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, you create custom analytics rules to help discover threats and anomalous behaviors in your environment.

Analytics rules search for specific events or sets of events across your environment, alert you when certain event thresholds or conditions are reached, generate incidents for your SOC to triage and investigate, and respond to threats with automated tracking and reMediation processes.

## Exercise instructions

### Task 1: Create a Scheduled Query

In this task, you create a scheduled query and connect it to the Teams channel you created in the previous exercise.

1. Log in to WIN1 virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.  

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Tenant Email** account provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Tenant Password** provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Sentinel*, then select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Select your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace.

1. Select **Analytics** from the Configuration area.

1. Make sure that you are in the *Rule templates* tab in the command bar and search for the **New CloudShell User** rule.

1. Select the **New CloudShell User** rule template, and "right-click" to open and select the **+ Create rule** button to open the *Analytic rule wizard*.

    >**Note:** You can also select the *ellipsis icon* (...) on the *New CloudShell User* rule template to open the *+ Create rule* wizard.

1. From the rule summary blade, make sure you're receiving data by reviewing the green icon under *Data sources: Azure Activity*.

 <!--->   >**Note:** If you do not see it in a connected state, make sure you completed Task 3 of the Learning Path 6 Lab, Exercise 1. --->

1. Select **Create rule** to continue.

1. In the Analytics rule wizard, on the *General* tab, change the *Severity* to **Medium**.

1. Select **Next: Set rule logic >** button:

1. For the rule query, select **View query results**. You shouldn't receive any results nor any errors.

1. Close the *Logs* window by selecting the upper right **X** and select **OK** to discard to save changes to go back to the wizard.

1. Scroll down and under *Query scheduling* set the following:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Run Query every|5 minutes|
    |Lookup data from the last|1 Days|

    >**Note:** We are purposely generating many incidents for the same data. This enables the Lab to use these alerts.

1. Under the *Alert threshold* area, leave the value unchanged since we want the alert to register every event.

1. Under the *Event grouping* area, leave the **Group all events into a single alert** as the selected option since we want to generate a single alert every time it runs, as long as the query returns more results than the specified alert threshold above.

1. Select the **Next: Incident settings >** button.

1. On the *Incident settings* tab, review the default options.

1. Select the **Next: Automated response >** button.


1. Select the **Next: Review and create >** button.
  
1. Select **Save**.

### Task 2: Test your new rule

In this task, you test your new scheduled query rule.


1. In the top bar of the Azure portal, Select the icon **>_** that corresponds to the Cloud Shell. You might need to select the ellipsis icon first **(...)** if your display resolution is too low.

1. In the *Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell* window, select **Powershell**.

1. On the *Getting started* page, select **Mount storage account**, and then select your **Azure Pass - Sponsorship** from the *storage account subscription* drop-down menu item and select the **Apply** button.

    >**Important:** Do not select the *No storage account required* radio button option. This wil cause the incident creation to fail.

1. On the *Mount storage account* page, select **We will create a storage account for you**, and then select **Next**.

1. Wait until the Cloud Shell is provisioned, then close the Azure Cloud Shell window.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Activity* and then select **Activity Log**.

1. Make sure the following *Operation name* items appear: **List Storage Account Keys** and **Update Storage Account Create**. These are the operations that the KQL query you reviewed earlier will match to generate the alert. **Hint:** You might need to select **Refresh** to update the list.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Sentinel*, then select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Select your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace.

1. Select the **Incidents** menu option under *Threat management*.

1. Select the **Auto-refresh incidents** toggle.

1. You should see the newly created Incident.

    >**Note:** The event that triggers the incident may take 5+ minutes to process. Continue with the next exercise, you will come back to this view later.

1. Select the Incident and review the information in the right blade.
