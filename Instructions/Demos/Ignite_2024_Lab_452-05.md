    title: 'Exercise 05: Create a Playbook'
    module: 'Guided Project - Create detections and perform investigations using Microsoft Sentinel'
---

## Exercise overview

You’re a Security Operations Architect working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to detect and mitigate threats using Microsoft Sentinel. Now, you want to respond and remediate actions that can be run from Microsoft Sentinel as a routine.

With a playbook, you can help automate and orchestrate your threat response, integrate with other systems both internal and external, and can be set to run automatically in response to specific alerts or incidents, when triggered by an analytics rule or an automation rule, respectively. With automation rules, you can apply automation for minimal to large tasks across one or more incidents/alerts in order to efficiently and optimally respond to threats and tasks.

## Exercise instructions

1. Select the solution that appears in the results.

1. Within the solution details, select **Install**.

1. Once installed, select Manage.

1. Find the **Defender_XDR_Ransomware_Playbook_for_SecOps_Tasks** playbook and select it.

1. Select the **Incident tasks - Microsoft Defender XDR Ransomware Playbook for SecOps** template.

1. On the details pane, select **Create playbook**.

1. For Resource Group, select **Create New**, enter **RG-Playbooks** and select OK.

1. Remove  *for* from the name (limit of 64 exceeded).

    >**Note:** Wait for the deployment to finish before proceeding to the next task.

### Task 2: Update a Playbook in Microsoft Sentinel

In this task, you’ll update the new playbook you created with the proper connection information.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type Sentinel, then select Microsoft Sentinel.

1. Select your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace.

1. Select Automation under the Configuration area and then select the Active Playbooks tab.

1. Select Refresh from the command bar in case you don’t see any playbooks. You should see the playbook created from the previous step.

1. Select the **Defender_XDR_Ransomware_Playbook_SecOps_Tasks** playbook name.

1. On the Logic App page for **Defender_XDR_Ransomware_Playbook_SecOps_Tasks**, in the command menu, select Edit.

    >**Note:** You may need to refresh the page.

1. Select the first block, Microsoft Sentinel incident.

1. Select the Change connection link.

1. Select Add new and select Sign in. In the new window, select your Azure subscription admin credentials when prompted. The last line of the block should now read “Connected to your-admin-username”.

1. Below within the logic split, select Add task to incident.

1. Select Save on the command bar. The Logic App will be used in a future lab.

### Task 3: Create an Automation Rule

1. Within Microsoft Sentinel, go to Automation under Configuration.

1. Select Create and choose Automation Rule.

1. Give the rule a name

1. Leave the incident provider as All.

1. Leave the Analytic rule name as All.

From here, depending on your role, you will either continue doing more architect exercises or you will pivot to the analyst exercises.
