## General guidelines

- When creating objects, use the default settings unless there are requirements that require different configurations.
- Only create, delete, or modify objects to achieve the stated requirements. Unnecessary changes to the environment may adversely affect your final score.
- If there are multiple approaches to achieving a goal, always choose the approach the requires the least amount of administrative effort.

We need to validate that our Microsoft Sentinel deployment is receiving security events from Windows virtual machines.
